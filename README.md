# End-to-End-SQL-Project
## Worked on an end-to-end SQL project to analyze a patient admission dataset. 
### Specifically, data relates to the Patients' date of admission, date of discharge, demographics such as age, sex, locality(rural or urban), type of admission(emergency or outpatient), patient history including smoking, alcohol, Diabetes Mellitus(DM), Hypertension, Prior coronary artery disease, Prior cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease. Also, lab parameters corresponding to hemoglobin, total lymphocyte count, platelets, glucose, urea, creatinine, etc, and other comorbidities including heart failure, shock, STEMI, ETC. The outcome indicating whether a patient was discharged, expired or discharged against medical advice was also recorded. 

### Advanced SQL Functions including Common table Expression(CTE), Joins, Window functions, Case Statements, etc were used for this analysis.

### Some of the Insights derived from this analysis include;
1. Patient readmission rate percentage.
2. Influence of patient locality on readmission
3. Gender distribution
4. Influence of Patients locality on mortality rate
5. Admission type (Emergency/Outpatient) distribution.
6. Compared the mortality rate between Emergency patients and Outpatients
7. Year-over-year admission rate
8. Month-over-month admission rate
9. Quarter-over-quarter admission rate
10. Average duration of stay and average duration of intensive unit stay for each admission type (Emergency/Outpatient)
11. Number of patients with a prior history of smoking, alcohol, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Prior Coronary Artery disease, Prior Cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease
12. Prevalence of smoking, alcohol, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Prior Coronary artery disease, Prior Cardiomyopathy and Chronic kidney disease
13. Mortality rate among patients with prior history, etc
